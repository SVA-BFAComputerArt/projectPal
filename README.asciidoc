ProjectPal is project deployment tool for animation and visual effects studios. A project consists of a folder structure and production software templates to ensure consistent organization.

Project creation begins with the client specifications for delivery. Options are available for dimensions, frame rate and color space. After the specs are chosen, the project folder structure
is created.

The folder structure begins with directories devoted to the entire project which include assets, inbound/outbound client folders and design documents. It continues with folders and templates 
devoted to each production software package in use such as Maya, After Effects, Nuke and Fusion. This ensures naming conventions and organization are consistent across all shots within a project.

Artists can begin work immediately with pre-built templates based on the project specifications.

This is all configured with an INI file that is easy for producers to update. If you need to add a new set of templates, add a folder named after the software with the templates, 
update the INI in the appropriate sections, and update the options in index.tpl to reflect the new type of software.

Shots can be added to a project as clients may require additional VFX work after the job begins.

General errors are reported to the end user (project exists, problem creating project...). More specific errors are written to the logs for the system administrator.
The page should stay up despite all errors. 

INSTALL:
The application was built using Python 3.3 and uses the Bottle library (version ?). No web server was used in writing this application. If you are running
ProjectPal within your network, you do not need an independent web server, the default bottle dev server will work just fine. I mean, hey, how many projects
are you going to create in your studio in one day anyway? (Well, ok, if Pixar starts using this thing, give me a call.)

To install and run, download the github repository and start the web sever by typing python prajectpal.py. You may need to install Bottle. It can be installed
using the normal methods, or simply put bottle.py in the root directory.

FILES:

projectpal.py is the main application and web interface
work.py is the guts of the app. This is where the magic happens (create dirs, add templates, etc)

TODO:

- add ability to switch machines (unc?)
- add funcitonality to create shot dirs
