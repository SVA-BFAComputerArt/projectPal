ProjectPal is project deployment tool for animation and visual effects studios. A project consists of a folder structure and production software templates to ensure consistent organization.

The directory structure is created based on the type of project. After the dir structure is created, certain directories are popluted with templates that correspond to specific types of software
that will be used for the project. This is all done through the ini file. If you need to add a new set of templates, 
add a folder named after the software with the templates, update the ini in the appropriate sections, and update the options in index.tpl to reflect the new type of software.

Once a project is created, several shots can be created within a project. Shots will also have a specific directory structure that will be poplulated
by templaetes based on the project type.

General errors are reported to the end user (project exists, problem creating project, etc). More specific errors are written to the logs for the sys admin.
The page should stay up despite all errors. 

INSTALL:
The application was built using Python 3.3 and uses the Bottle library (version ?). No web server was used in writing this application. If you are running
projectpal within your network, you do not need an independent web server, the default bottle dev server will work just fine. I mean, hey, how many projects
are you going to create in your studio in one day anyway? (Well, ok, if Pixar starts using this thing, give me a call.)

To install and run, download the github repository and start the web sever by typing python prajectpal.py. You may need to install Bottle. It can be installed
using the normal methods, or simply put bottle.py in the root directory.

FILES:

projectpal.py is the main application and web interface
work.py is the guts of the app. This is where the magic happens (create dirs, add templates, etc)

TODO:

- add ability to switch machines (unc?)
- add funcitonality to create shot dirs
